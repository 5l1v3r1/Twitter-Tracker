# Twitter-Tracker
Tracks a user's activity without using the Twitter API and sends notifications through Telegram.

# Requirements
 - [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)
 - [twitter-scraper](https://github.com/bisguzar/twitter-scraper)

# How to set it up
Edit the `CHAT_ID`, `USERNAME, USERID`, `TOKEN` variables accordingly.


# Things to do
- [ ] Create the `db.json` file automatically if it doesn't exist.
- [ ] Use the `user ID` instead of the `username` so even if the user changes it's username, you will still be able to track them.
